 * Total Submissions: 3.5M
 * Testcase Example:  '121'
 *
 * Given an integer x, return true if x is palindrome integer.
 *
 * An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.
 *
 *
 * For example, 121 is a palindrome while 123 is not.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: x = 121
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: x = -121
 * Output: false
 * Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it
 * becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
 *
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 *
 * Input: x = 10
 * Output: false
 * Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a
 * palindrome.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * -2^31 <= x <= 2^31 - 1
 *
 *
 *
 * Follow up: Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?
